# Active Decision Log — HORMATHOS (deposited design 3.1)

V3-001 and V3-002 were written in Italian. Since V3-012 this log holds their English translation; their Italian originals govern and are preserved byte for byte at the tag `hormathos-v5-evidence`, each identified by the SHA-256 at the head of its translation. V3-003 and every later entry were written in English.

## V3-001 — Adoption of v3.1 and first tranche V0–V1

> **English translation; the Italian original governs** (V3-012). The original is the three V3-001 blocks, from the first `## V3-001 —` heading up to, excluding, `## V3-002 —`, of `docs/02_DECISION_LOG.md` at the tag `hormathos-v5-evidence`, preserved byte for byte; SHA-256 of that UTF-8 text `8ee0f130ac59085862c940c0804fc25733a7a12f9e83bb0abf95c18c9fba8864`. Translated on 2026-09-25 as a companion (V3-003) and moved into this log on 2026-09-27. Structure, values and identifiers follow the original; numbers use English notation; any translator's note is marked *[Translator's note: …]* and changes nothing in the original.

**Date of the deposit: 2026-09-16. Status: ADOPTED for the new executions.** Source of authorization: the user's request in the current session to implement the definitive plan V0–V1. No earlier authorizations or V2–V5 activities are attributed to this request.

The [v3.1 plan](contracts/hexis-3.1/HEXIS_piano_definitivo_v3.1_2026-09-15.md) and the deposited contracts constitute the only active authority. The [external record](V3-001-deposit.json) identifies all the bytes; the original statuses `FINAL_PLAN_NOT_APPLIED` and `V0_deposit: null` in the materials remain intact and describe the earlier delivery. The present act adopts their content without modifying what the digests identify. The deposit commit will be referenced by the subsequent manifest, without self-reference.

For v3.1 the following are **not applicable**: P1/P2 inference, Latin, O7 as an operational block, permutation constants, G0–G7 and their order, earlier sensitivities, sign-stability, Rissanen selector/penalties, sequences with SEP/#, chunks and reference models. They are replaced by §§3–14 of v3.1: Greek, seven blocks, frozen CTW, two arms, six cells, targets j≥4, SHA-256 RNG, V0–V5 checklist. O7 is not declared resolved nor G2 passed in the v2.1 project.

What remains: bits/log base 2, tests before code, strict checks and determinism, immutable raw files, no import from candidates, label-free core/separate annotation, no new dependency or implicit bibliographic source. The new A/B thresholds are diagnostics. The 17 historical skips do not constitute active acceptance: the future obligations are explicitly PENDING in the [inventory](TEST_INVENTORY.md).

Epistemic history: real pilots were observed; this is a prospective protocol after development, not a preregistration preceding the data. The verified coverage and the limits are in §2 of the plan and in the deposited verdict. The account `contracts/hexis-3.1/HEXIS_v3_allegati/authorization_and_experiments.json` is the source of the earlier authorizations **with the verifiability declared there**: it is not an independently verified original consent; missing dates/times are not reconstructed. The 25 archived synthetic outcomes are historical evidence, not acceptance of the future canonical CTW. No new real fit is authorized by this tranche.

D01–D54 are kept in full below. [D55](g1_D55_proposal.md) remains PROPOSED, applied to nothing in v2.1; the [G1 technical ratifications](g1_ratification_record.md) keep exactly their original statuses. The PDF proposal and the backup README are historical; the rewriting of the proposal and the publication remain separate.

*[Translator's note: since V3-002 (22 September 2026), D01–D54, D55 and the G1 ratifications are preserved under `archive/docs/`, so the relative links above no longer resolve in the active tree; the original is reproduced as written.]*

## V3-001 — Execution note V2, 2026-09-17

The user's current request authorizes the resumption and completion of the V2 plan
on the branch `codex/hexis31-v0-v1`, with a subsequent complete review and a stop before
V3. This source is distinct from the V0–V1 request of the deposit: no new authorizations
are retroactively attributed to it. No real fit, publication or change of the normative
bytes is included in the resumption.

§11.1 is applied keeping the public names `pooled_score_core` and
`annotate_scores` with APIs for the paired slots and for the annotation of the registry.
The five/three-argument signatures of the v2.1 protocol are replaced, together with their
expected signatures; the valid constraint of independence from the labels remains
verified, now behaviourally too. This technical adjustment implements
V3-001 and does not retroactively ratify G0/D52. Evidence and the V3–V5 limit
in the [handoff](HANDOFF.md) and in the [inventory](TEST_INVENTORY.md).

---

## V3-001 — Execution note pre-V3, 2026-09-22

The complete review requested by the user before V3 received four explicit decisions
(D1–D4, [handoff](HANDOFF.md)). Only the deviation from the text of the contract is recorded here.

**CLI (§14.1).** The lines of §14.1 are commands in principle. The implemented entry points
additionally require explicit destinations: `--data-root`/`--output-dir` for audit and encoding;
`--corpus-dir`/`--output-dir` for `run_descriptive`, `run_report` and for publishing the
evidence with `run_tree_validation`; `--regenerated-dir` for the scientific report (§12.2). They
also accept `--seed 0`, `--resume` and `--fixture`. Reason: §11.7 forbids implicit overwrites and
requires atomic publication in a new destination or in a verified resumption, so no
destination is inferred. No scientific parameter passes through the CLI: cells, seeds and weights remain
those of the deposited projection. No clause, expected value or contractual byte is modified.

## V3-002 — Realignment of the repository and publication act, 2026-09-22

> **English translation; the Italian original governs** (V3-012). The original is the V3-002 act, from the heading `## V3-002 —` up to, excluding, `## V3-003 —`, of `docs/02_DECISION_LOG.md` at the tag `hormathos-v5-evidence`, preserved byte for byte; SHA-256 of that UTF-8 text `094a686e52841202b7185d383f48f1e8619e8ae11db934ea61a6966b7d01c5ed`. Translated on 2026-09-25 as a companion (V3-003) and moved into this log on 2026-09-27. Structure, values and identifiers follow the original; numbers use English notation; any translator's note is marked *[Translator's note: …]* and changes nothing in the original.

**Status: ADOPTED; publication act effective from 2026-09-23 with the push of the branch `codex/hexis31-realign` at `2ebb3464b871c1f831d0608edba052ccb4b92be9` and of the tags `archive/pre-realign` and `archive/v2.1`; the merge into `master` and the deletion of `g1/pre-audit` (E5) follow.** Source of authorization: the user's request of 22 September 2026 to align the repository fully with the v3.1 plan before the code review and V3, with the decisions E1–E8 and N1–N4 reported below. The act modifies no byte of the deposit nor the three V3-001 blocks above, which remain the acts of 16, 17 and 22 September. Base: `5f1ec06afa192c8d0f006d7f39cdb97df72c2983`. v2.1 history already public: `852644b6917790877c7b2ca5df2e76b17829d87c`. The annotated tags `archive/pre-realign` and `archive/v2.1` point to these two commits; the normative anchors are the SHAs, not the tag names.

**Archive (§13.1 items 4–5, §17.3).** Everything that does not belong to the 3.1 path leaves the active tree and enters `archive/`, with this rule: the file that at `5f1ec06` was at `P` is now at `archive/P`, with the same bytes. `archive/` is not imported, is not collected by pytest, does not enter the identity of the code (`src/hexis`) nor the context of the V2 evidence (`tests/*.py`). It is a record, not an executable tree: each item is executed at `5f1ec06`, where its code is alive. Two active tests bind it: none of its files is collected, not even by `pytest .`, and each of its files has the blob it had at the base. Status of the items:

| Item | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| D01–D54, specification, roadmap, handoff and v2.1 instructions | `archive/docs/history/v2.1/` | FROZEN for v2.1; no authority for new executions; bytes verified by their `SHA256SUMS.json` |
| D55 | `archive/docs/g1_D55_proposal.md` | PROPOSED, applied to nothing |
| G1 technical ratifications and registry proposal | `archive/docs/g1_*` | Original statuses; they ratify neither the corpus nor the 3.1 analysis |
| `candidates/` | `archive/candidates/` | Quarantined (D47); no import |
| Statistical utilities and their tests (§13.2) | `archive/src/hexis/stats/`, `archive/tests/` | Historical, working at `5f1ec06`; no import in the pipeline |
| Registry, sequences, blocks, v2.1 lexicon, `legacy_audit`, five retired stages | `archive/src/hexis/…` | Retired; replaced by `corpus.py`, `sampling.py`, `corpus_run.py`, `run_descriptive.py` |
| v2.1, G0, G1 and scaffold tests, including the 17 skips | `archive/tests/` | Historical; destination of each test in the map of [TEST_INVENTORY](TEST_INVENTORY.md) |
| PDF proposal v2, backup README, PDF v2.0, audits, implementation plans | `archive/` | Superseded; the 3.1 proposal (§17.1) is still to be written |
| G1 pre-audit tables and logs | `archive/results/` | Not canonical; already public since the push of `852644b` |
| v2.1 configuration | `archive/config/history/v2.1/` | Historical |
| Handoff, inventory and reconciliation register at `5f1ec06` | `archive/docs/` | Detailed V0–V2 account cited by the V3-001 notes |
| README at `5f1ec06` | `archive/README.md` | Historical; the status of the items is in this table |

**Point supersessions of V3-001 (its bytes do not change).** «D01–D54 are kept in full below» is to be read as kept in full in `archive/docs/history/v2.1/02_DECISION_LOG.md`, which is byte for byte the appendix removed from this log. The links to `g1_D55_proposal.md`, `g1_ratification_record.md`, and the V3-001 notes on the evidence in HANDOFF and in the inventory, resolve with the `archive/P` rule. «The 17 historical skips…» now has an outcome: the skips are archived with their files, and no active test is a skip. «No import from candidates» remains in force. «Only the deviation from the text of the contract is recorded here», in the pre-V3 note, is to be read together with deviations 4 and 5 below.

**Declared deviations.**
1. **§13.2, paths.** The map indicates `registry.py`, `sequences.py` and `stats/` as the places of the work. The corresponding 3.1 functions have lived since V1–V2 in `corpus.py` and `sampling.py`. The statistical utilities are kept as historical in the archive instead of in `src/hexis/stats/`, and their tests are not executed in the active tree.
2. **v2.1 code in the live modules.** Removed are:
   - in `alphabet.py`: the frequency IDs, the inventory, the freeze and the v2.1 A/B audit, the `available_past` column of `map_tokens` (the 3.1 one is in `coordinates`);
   - in `config.py`: the loader, the merge and the v2.1 G1 forms, `config_hash`, and `derive_seed` based on CRC32 (the contract uses SHA-256);
   - in `scores.py`: the three stubs and the alias `score_streams`, because the name of the contract is `pooled_score_core` (§11.1);
   - in `manifest.py`: the writer of the v2.1 manifest and sidecars.

   The retired stages no longer exist: it is a stronger constraint than refusing to execute them (§13.2, «retire CLIs»). `check_output_locations`, `staged_inputs` and `verify_inputs_unchanged`, with their dependencies `_conllu_paths` and `CANONICAL_DATA_ROOT`, move from `legacy_audit` to `corpus_run`. The comparison with `ast.dump` gives identical `check_output_locations`, `staged_inputs` and `_conllu_paths`, with two declared differences. The refusal message of `verify_inputs_unchanged` cites §11.7 instead of «§6.4, D46», a retired reference; logic, conditions and exception type are unchanged. `CANONICAL_DATA_ROOT` is the `data/raw` root of the repository and no longer a path relative to the current directory (code review of 23 September), and the equivalent check that `check_destination` repeated is removed.
3. **Pre-V3 freeze.** The freeze declared on 22 September covered `src/hexis`, the tests, `conftest.py`, `pyproject.toml`, the configuration and the lock. It is reopened here, before any V2 or V3 publication: under `results/hexis31/` only the V1 runs exist. The attestation of `0dc69b5` (351 v31; 672 passed plus 17 skips) remains evidence for that commit. The V2 acceptance is re-attested on the commit of the realignment. The corpus `results/hexis31/v1` remains the V3 corpus: its identity is by content, `validate_run` does not bind the code, and the realignment must reproduce its nine artifacts byte for byte. Configuration, lock, deposit and raw files remain unchanged.
4. **§11.2, ledger.** The plan names a `sample_ledger.json` that also contains q. The ledger is published as one file per distinct sample, `sample_ledger__<sha256>.json`, cited by hash by every pair that uses it; q is in the record of the pair and is derived exactly from the rows, as the sum of `end − start` per contributor. A single file would have to be rewritten at every published pair, while §11.7 wants the published artifacts immutable.
5. **§9.1, peak RSS.** The `peak_rss` of each model is the maximum reached by the process up to that model (`resource.getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss`), not the peak of the isolated model: in a sequential campaign it is an upper bound. Each record declares it in `rss_method`.

Deviations 4 and 5 are implemented since V2 and so far were described only in the handoff, in the inventory and in the reconciliation register now in `archive/docs/`, which are not an authority.

**Deposit.** The V0 commit `e98fb8e` had deposited 64 files, among them `hexis-verifica/.DS_Store` (6,148 bytes, sha256 `18cc90e9ff3e6473b1790a06f5bbf5afb3be60f5359284118c94b4f8383df96b`, containing only the names of the files of the folder). It did not appear in the `SHA256SUMS.json` of the package. The V1 commit `7afdd3a` removed it together with its line in the record, without documenting it. It is recorded here. The remaining 63 digests are unchanged.

**Owner decisions of 22 September 2026 (D1–D4, already in HANDOFF).**
- D1: no public push without a publication act. It is superseded by the act below, which becomes effective only at the push.
- D2: the validator regenerates ledgers, shuffle counts and C0 provenance.
- D3: the CLI deviation is recorded in the V3-001 note.
- D4: the figures have been corrected.

D2–D4 remain implemented by `0dc69b5`.

**Publication act (§17.3).**
- *Perimeter.* All objects reachable from the published branch and tags that are not already on `origin`: the history after `852644b`, not only the final tree. What lies up to and including `852644b` is public since the push of `g1/pre-audit`.
- *Code and configuration* (`src/`, `tests/`, `conftest.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `config/`, and the code and configuration kept under `archive/`): MIT licence, [LICENSE](../LICENSE), which at its head refers to this act for everything that is not code.
- *Documents and contractual deposit*: the documents of the project, including those under `archive/` and the PDFs; the metadata `data/provenance_v31.json` and `data/raw/PROVENANCE.md`; the contractual deposit as a single work — texts, JSON, scripts and ZIP archives — published byte for byte as deposited: **CC BY 4.0**, with attribution to Leonardo Tornabene. They are the author's work and must remain citable in review. The licence of the code extends neither to the documents nor to the data.
- *Derivatives of the corpus UD Ancient Greek Perseus r2.18* (CC BY-NC-SA 2.5):
  - (a) **per-position symbols:** `ctw_validation/pilot_positions_example.npz`, sha256 `738f0ccbe395a562cd47435f984474d6c2206dcac7757a38eb4b0c5575e89fec`, with 46,634 positions of the historical pilot (`loss`, `root_loss`, `weighted_depth`, `matched_depth`, `unseen_weight`, `past`);
  - (b) **coordinates:** the 70 `ctw_validation/ledger_<cella>_B<k>.json`, with `sent_id` and intervals of the samples of the pilots, and the point citations of `sent_id` in `hexis-verifica/evidenze/corpus_audit.json` and `audit_corpus.md`;
  - (c) **aggregates:** results of the pilots, counts, inventories and alphabets of the contracts, counts fixed in the tests, G1 pre-audit tables in `archive/results/`.

  Files (a) and (b) are in `HEXIS_v3_allegati/verifiche_CTW_precedenti.zip`, sha256 `85fce2a6462fd741b2cc5616aa85863ef4c25235a84b463da1e6c6e6e35f6198` (in `V3-001-deposit.json`). The same ZIP appears three more times, identical, inside the ZIPs of the deposit. The digest of each file is in `ctw_validation/FILE_HASHES.json`, that is among the 103 internal digests verified by V3-001 and rechecked on 22 September. Licence of the corpus derivatives, categories (a), (b) and (c): **CC BY-NC-SA 2.5**, the same as the source, with attribution to UD Ancient Greek Perseus r2.18 at commit `37837c7a3c592c9563f8c51cc63344b87247f8a5` and to AGDT/Perseus. It is not a choice among possible licences: ShareAlike imposes the licence of the source on an adaptation and NonCommercial forbids the use that a permissive licence would grant, so declaring MIT on these files would be a promise that the author is not in a position to keep.
- *Precedence by portions.* A corpus derivative keeps CC BY-NC-SA 2.5 also inside a file of another category: inventories and alphabets in the JSON of the contract, counts fixed in the tests, files (a) and (b) inside the ZIPs of the deposit. Those portions follow the licence of the corpus; the rest of the file follows its own. No byte is under two licences.
- *Residual clause.* Every file of the perimeter not named above, in the tree or in the history, follows the category of its nature: code or configuration MIT, document or metadata CC BY 4.0, corpus derivative CC BY-NC-SA 2.5.
- *Not published:* the raw files (`data/raw` remains ignored; `PROVENANCE.md` contains only hashes and acquisition metadata) and the local runs `results/hexis31/`.
- *Scope in time:* the act covers only what exists today. The C0 per-position vectors of the V4–V5 campaign, when they exist, are not included and require an act of their own.
- *Effect:* at the first push; after publication it is not withdrawn. The check with the editorial venue foreseen here has no addressee: on 23 September 2026 the venue cannot be determined and the probable destination is a preprint archive. Publication therefore happens without a venue. The corpus derivatives remain in this repository, or in a deposit of it with a DOI, under their licence; a future text cites them by link and does not include them among its own files. The licence of that text is a future decision (*Scope in time*).

**Decisions.**
- E1: the deposit remains intact.
- E2: licences decided on 22 September 2026 — MIT for the code, CC BY 4.0 for the author's documents, CC BY-NC-SA 2.5 for the corpus derivatives. Precedence by portions, residual clause and scope note in LICENSE decided on 23 September 2026, after the code review.
- E3: publication of everything, by name.
- E4: the v2 PDF goes into the archive without a replacement.
- E5: the remote branch `g1/pre-audit` is deleted after the merge, once its ancestry is verified.
- E6: the appendix D01–D54 leaves the log.
- E7: handoff and inventory are rewritten as the current state.
- E8: every collected test is v31.
- E9: publication without a determined editorial venue (23 September 2026); the corpus derivatives are cited by link.
- N1: the verification workspace lies outside the repository.
- N2: coverage differential with the standard library only.
- N3: one guard line on the retired elements in the instructions.
- N4: `archive/P` rule.
- `data/raw/PROVENANCE.md` remains tracked.
- The merge into master will happen with a merge commit, without squash or rebase.

## V3-003 — Project name HORMATHOS and project language, 2026-09-23

**Status: ADOPTED.** Source of authorization: the owner's requests of 23 September 2026 — the name HORMATHOS, the rename of both the project and its package, the variant that keeps the distribution name, and English as the language of every project artifact — with the decisions A1–A6 and B1–B5 below. The act changes no byte of the deposit, and no byte of the V3-001 and V3-002 acts, which remain as adopted.

**Name.** The project and its software are HORMATHOS, from Greek ὁρμαθός, a chain of things hanging one from another: in Plato's *Ion* (533e) the long chain of iron rings below a magnet, whose force passes through each ring to the next (B11). The name describes the method: each annotation symbol is predicted from its predecessors in the same sentence, and the chain breaks where the sentence ends. HEXIS 3.1 remains the name of the deposited design that HORMATHOS implements; `hexis` survives only where the design or its history fixes it.

**What keeps the name `hexis`, and why.**
- The deposit, `docs/contracts/hexis-3.1/`, with its file names: `SHA256SUMS.json`, `design_lock.json` and `V3-001-deposit.json` identify them.
- The contract identifiers `spec_version: HEXIS-3.1`, `representation_version: hexis-3.1-adv-part-1` and `rng.version: hexis-v3-rng-1`. The last one is part of the SHA-256 payload of every draw (§12.2): changing it would change every sample and break the deposited vector.
- The persisted schema names `hexis-corpus-manifest-1` and `hexis-scientific-manifest-2`: the V1 corpus manifest carries the first, and `validate_run` accepts no other.
- The distribution name in `pyproject.toml`. `uv.lock` records it, and the deposited design fixes the lock bytes (`runtime.policy: preserve_existing_repository_lock`, `runtime.lock_sha256: 33db43b00bcb21ab12aedf6dcc4257764770bff0115dc0d1dfab6e5ea89876bf`); `config/default.yaml` repeats the value, `corpus_run` refuses a different lock and `scientific_run.run_contract` compares the present lock with the corpus's. Renaming the distribution would make the V1 corpus unusable and V3 impossible without a new deposit.
- `archive/`, the Git history and tags, and the local run directory `results/hexis31/`, whose V1 manifest SHA-256 is recorded in the handoff.

**Declared deviations.**
1. **Names in the text of the plan and of the acts.** The package is `src/hormathos`. Where §13.2 names `src/hexis/<module>` and §14.1 names `python -m hexis.pipeline.<stage>`, read `src/hormathos/<module>` and `python -m hormathos.pipeline.<stage>`; modules, stages and semantics are unchanged. The same reading applies where V3-001 and V3-002 name `src/hexis` as the active package (the code identity, the freeze perimeter, deviation 1 of V3-002); archive paths `archive/src/hexis/…` stay as they are. Where §13.1 names `docs/00_LEGGIMI_INDICE.md` and `docs/03_ROADMAP_OPERATIVA_IT.md`, read `docs/00_INDEX.md` and `docs/03_ROADMAP.md`.
2. **Hash of the V3-001 acts.** The test that keeps the V3-001 acts unchanged now hashes from the first V3-001 heading instead of from the first byte of the file: the title of this log is not an act, and it follows the project name. The act bytes are unchanged: the old prefix (SHA-256 `df5ca735f4d9f0f450c147518d138e994a2818e0119e3fec95827c9e81760e6f`) is exactly the old title followed by the acts, whose SHA-256 is `8ee0f130ac59085862c940c0804fc25733a7a12f9e83bb0abf95c18c9fba8864`.

**Language.** From this act on every project artifact is written in English: code, tests, configuration, commit messages and documents. The Italian originals of the deposit and of V3-001 and V3-002 govern and are never translated in place; English translations of them, when added, are companions without authority. The active documents are translated, and the index and the roadmap take English file names.

**Identity and freeze.** The rename changes the code identity before any V2 or V3 evidence is published, as the realignment did (V3-002, deviation 3): under `results/hexis31/` there are only the V1 runs. The V1 corpus remains the V3 corpus: under the renamed package it is accepted as it is, its regeneration reproduces the nine artifacts byte for byte, and every field of its run contract other than the code equals the regenerated one.

**Outside the repository.** The GitHub repository is renamed HORMATHOS with the description "Project HORMATHOS", and the local remote URL follows; then the local directory is renamed and the virtual environment rebuilt. Each step needs the owner's explicit go, and until then the old names remain.

**Decisions.**
- A1: rename the project and the package (scope A+B); the package in the variant that keeps the distribution name `hexis`.
- A2: identity formula — HORMATHOS is the project and its software; HEXIS 3.1 is the deposited design it implements.
- A3: strings that name the software become HORMATHOS; strings that name the design or a contract identifier stay.
- A4: `results/hexis31/`, `docs/proposal/` and `scripts/` keep their paths; the message in `scripts/reacquire_raw_data.sh` names HORMATHOS.
- A5: order — tests, package, documents, verification, local commits, push, GitHub, local directory, with a stop for review after each phase.
- A6: English for every artifact; Italian is only the language of the owner's requests.
- B1: the V3-001 hash starts at the first V3-001 heading (deviation 2).
- B2: the Italian originals govern; translations are companions without authority.
- B3: the companion translations of the plan, of V3-001 and V3-002 and of the other Italian texts of the deposit are a separate tranche.
- B4: the English version of the research proposal comes with the decision to track it.
- B5: the index and the roadmap become `00_INDEX.md` and `03_ROADMAP.md`.
- R1–R4, from the review of the rename before its publication (23 September 2026): the sdist is a closed list equal to the tracked tree (R1); the pipeline runs from a checkout and the wheel alone does not run it, as declared in the README (R2); the per-pair revalidation of the V1 corpus is kept as it is, with its cost recorded in the handoff (R3); Plato's *Ion* is registered as B11, and the Italian left in docstrings and comments is translated (R4).

## V3-004 — Pre-V3 audit closure and regeneration tolerance, 2026-09-24

**Status: ADOPTED.** This act records the pre-V3 audit correction before changing the implementation. For §12.2 regeneration, the absolute tolerance is 10⁻⁸ bit per eligible target. A sum of losses over `n` eligible targets has absolute tolerance `n × 10⁻⁸` bit. There is no relative tolerance. Identities, keys, counts and other discrete fields remain exact. This rule applies to JSON and Parquet comparisons; a fingerprint of floating point bytes may differ only when its underlying values satisfy this rule.

Two local directories establish matching identities and values, not how their bytes were produced. Independent execution of the §12.2 commands remains procedural evidence to record during the campaign; a copied directory cannot be identified from the directories alone. No real fit is authorized by this act.

## V3-005 — Closure of the V3 review and re-attestation of V2 and seed 0, 2026-09-24

**Status: ADOPTED.** This act closes the review of V3 held on 24 September 2026.

**(a) Outcome of the review.** The review found no defect in the V3 results. It found three fixes of `2a16a81` that no test failed without: the coordinate-order check when `doc_id` is categorical (R4), the rollback branch that keeps every artifact when the manifest on disk is unreadable (R5), and the `samefile` refusal of a raw-data alias that path resolution misses (R6). One test is added for each, and the existing raw-alias test asserts its message in place of `assert True`. The README test that pinned the V2-phase status sentence is replaced by properties that hold in every phase. `src/hormathos` does not change.

**(b) The runs of 24 September.** The V2 evidence binds `tests/*.py` (`validation_run.context`), and V4 (`run_descriptive --resume`) and V5 (`run_report`) recheck that context against the current tree. After this act `results/hexis31/v2-pre-v3-audit-2026-09-24`, `v3-seed0` and `v3-seed0-regeneration` can no longer be resumed or reported: they remain historical evidence, unchanged, and are never resumed. The run ID does not change, because the tests are outside the run contract.

**(c) Authorized fits.** This act authorizes only the rerun of V2 and of seed 0 in `results/hexis31/v3-seed0-r4-r6` (`run_tree_validation`, then `run_descriptive --seed 0` in the three invocations of 24 September: `--cell C0`, `--cell D12 --resume`, `--cell all --resume`) and its §12.2 regeneration in `results/hexis31/v3-seed0-r4-r6-regeneration` (`run_tree_validation`, then one `run_descriptive --seed 0`): 42 pairs and 84 models per directory. No other real fit is authorized; V4 waits for the owner's review.

**(d) Scope of the regeneration comparator.** The comparator of `validation_run` (`_same`, `_regenerated`) applies V3-004 as follows. In JSON, every float other than a loss sum is compared at 10⁻⁸ absolute in its native unit; a `sum_loss_*` field at `n × 10⁻⁸`, with `n` taken from the same record. In Parquet, every float column is compared at 10⁻⁸ absolute. Identities, keys, counts, strings, integers and numeric dtypes are exact. The `fingerprint` field is excluded, because the tree it hashes is not saved and its values cannot be recompared from the artifacts. This narrows the sentence of V3-004 on fingerprints, and the comment and docstring of the comparator that say the same, to what the code does; the comparator does not change. If a future regeneration yields a different fingerprint, the passage stops and the difference is assessed before any acceptance.

## V3-006 — Pre-V4 review fixes and re-attestation of V2 and seed 0, 2026-09-24

**Status: ADOPTED.** This act closes the review of the whole package held before V4 on 24 September 2026.

**(a) Outcome of the review.** A review of all of `src/hormathos` found four defects of quality; none changes a result of V3. `verify_sequences` compared eligibility with a literal 4 instead of `min_available_past` (F1). `pooled_score_core` copied the whole prefix of the stream at every scored position, although the path reads only its last D symbols (F2). `corpus_run.publish_stage` and `scientific_run.publish_stage` carried two copies of the same reservation, staging and rollback sequence (F3). `run_report.reconstruct` was called by nothing and had drifted from the live join, which passes the document universe (F4). The further suggestion to derive the CE loss from the `Mixture` object is not adopted: `Mixture` does not carry the nodes, and a new summation order could change the bits of the losses.

**(b) Changes.** Tests first: one test for F1 and one for F2, in `tests/test_v31_pre_v4_review.py`, each failing on the previous code. F1 reads the threshold from the design. F2 passes the last D symbols, so the losses are bit for bit those of the full prefix. F3 moves the shared sequence into `corpus_run.reserved` and `corpus_run.stage_artifacts`; each stage keeps its own checks, manifest and round-trip verification, and the existing publication tests cover it. F4 removes the function. The code identity changes, and with it the run ID.

**(c) The runs of V3-005.** `results/hexis31/v3-seed0-r4-r6` and `v3-seed0-r4-r6-regeneration` can no longer be resumed or reported: they remain historical evidence, unchanged, and are never resumed. The V1 corpus stays valid: its validation reads the artifact bytes, and `run_audit` and `run_encode` on the new code regenerate its nine artifacts byte for byte.

**(d) Authorized fits.** This act authorizes only the rerun of V2 and of seed 0 in `results/hexis31/v3-seed0-v3006`, with the three invocations of V3-005 (c), and its §12.2 regeneration in `results/hexis31/v3-seed0-v3006-regeneration`: 42 pairs and 84 models per directory. The artifacts of `v3-seed0-v3006` are compared with those of `v3-seed0-r4-r6`: keys and values must agree within the tolerance of V3-004, and only fields that record the code or the run identity may differ; any other difference stops the passage before acceptance. V4 (`run_descriptive --resume`) then runs on `v3-seed0-v3006` and on no other directory, after the owner's review of this re-attestation.

## V3-007 — Publication of the finished results and reorganization for readers, 2026-09-25

**Status: ADOPTED.** Source of authorization: the owner's request of 25 September 2026 that the finished results be visible and that anyone who opens the repository can understand it and find their way, touching the freeze perimeter only where needed and without damage. This is the act of its own that V3-002 (*Scope in time*) requires for the C0 position vectors and the other corpus derivatives of the V4–V5 campaign. It modifies no byte of the deposit, of the V3-001 and V3-002 blocks or of `archive/`, and authorizes no run.

**(a) Published in the repository**, byte for byte, under `results/hexis31/`: the delivered corpus `v1`; of `v3-seed0-v3006`, the 13 tables, the five figures, `manifest.json` and the three V2 evidence files; of `v3-seed0-v3006-regeneration`, `manifest.json` and the three V2 evidence files; the logs and check scripts in `v3-seed0-v3006-logs/`, `v4-logs/` and `v5-logs/`. Two checks that the handoff cited from outside the repository are published: the V3-005 mutation review in `results/hexis31/v3-005-review/`, and the companion check `check_companions.py` with `pairs_all.json` in `docs/contracts/hexis-3.1-en/`, outside the deposit root. The per-pair records, sample ledgers and C0 position partitions, and every other run, stay ignored by Git.

**(b) Published as archives of the GitHub Release `hexis31-v5-evidence`:**

- `hormathos-campaign-v3006.tar.gz`, SHA-256 `3dadf6cecc303281897995b84c479721ce56e304859456f18dd9abb0164bec10`: `v1`; `v3-seed0-v3006` complete, its manifest and 931 artifacts, among them 490 pair records, 280 sample ledgers and 140 C0 position partitions; `v3-seed0-v3006-regeneration` complete, its manifest and 73 artifacts.
- `hormathos-superseded-runs.tar.gz`, SHA-256 `1a4fbf43b021dd442285927e8a76e687d905020220d2a29e9c4931f368a42cc3`: `v1-development`, `v1-reproduction`, `v2-pre-v3-audit-2026-09-24`, `v3-seed0`, `v3-seed0-regeneration`, `v3-seed0-r4-r6`, `v3-seed0-r4-r6-regeneration` and their logs. They are historical: superseded by V3-005 and V3-006, never resumed, without authority over the results.

Every run extracted from the two archives passes `validate_run`.

**(c) Licences**, by the categories of V3-002. Everything derived from the corpus — the encoded corpus, tables, figures, manifests, pair records, sample ledgers with their `sent_id` and the C0 position vectors — is under **CC BY-NC-SA 2.5**, with attribution to UD Ancient Greek Perseus r2.18 at commit `37837c7a3c592c9563f8c51cc63344b87247f8a5` and to AGDT/Perseus. Logs and documents are under CC BY 4.0, check scripts under MIT; precedence by portions applies to corpus-derived values quoted in them.

**(d) Freeze perimeter.** Only `pyproject.toml` changes: its sdist `only-include` list gains `"results"` and `"docs/RESULTS.md"`, which `test_the_sdist_ships_exactly_the_tracked_tree` requires of every tracked file; the property and the test are unchanged. `src/hormathos`, `tests/`, `conftest.py`, `config/` and `uv.lock` are unchanged, so the code identity and run ID `6aa1b719…` are unchanged. `pyproject.toml` belongs to the context of the V2 evidence (`validation_run.context`): from this act on, `run_descriptive --resume` and `run_report` refuse `v3-seed0-v3006` on `master`, as the perimeter prescribes, and no further run is authorized. `validate_run` does not read the current context and keeps accepting the published runs. The code and perimeter of the evidence are fixed by the annotated tag `hexis31-v5-evidence` at `9814871726bfec9dc96da316f61eeafbe58b3f48`, identical in the perimeter to `1cf3bda`, where V4 and V5 ran; any rerun of the report starts from there.

**(e) Reorganization for readers.** The statement of results and limitations of V5 moves from the handoff to `docs/RESULTS.md`, with its wording unchanged except a preface and six sentences that said where its evidence was. The README becomes the entry page: result, reading map, layout, reproduction, how the project was made — declaring the use of AI coding assistants — and licences. `results/README.md` describes the published files; `docs/00_INDEX.md` becomes a reading guide. No file is renamed.

**(f) Not published:** the raw data, as V3-002 decides; the drafts in `docs/proposal/`, whose publication belongs to the proposal (§17.1); `scripts/`, a local acquisition aid.

## V3-008 — Reader-facing name HORMATHOS and the release alias tag, 2026-09-25

**Status: ADOPTED.** Source of authorization: the owner's request of 25 September 2026 that the name HORMATHOS replace HEXIS 3.1 wherever possible, in the Release above all, frozen documents included if needed, provided scientific integrity is not compromised; with the decisions C1–C2 below. It amends A2 and A3 of V3-003. It modifies no byte of the deposit, of the acts V3-001 to V3-007, of `archive/`, of `results/` or of the freeze perimeter, and authorizes no run.

**Name.** HORMATHOS names the project, its software and the study. Reader-facing texts present the design as the deposited design (plan 3.1). HEXIS 3.1 is the working title under which the design was deposited on 15 September 2026; the README records it once, as provenance. It is not renamed where it is part of what was deposited or of what the evidence fixes.

**What keeps `hexis`, and why.** Everything V3-003 lists, for the reasons given there, and further:
- the English companions in `docs/contracts/hexis-3.1-en/`: they translate texts titled HEXIS, and a translation does not rename its original; their path mirrors the deposit and is published with `pairs_all.json` (V3-007 (a));
- `results/hexis31/`: the published manifests record `corpus_dir` and `output_dir` under this path, `test_v31_pre_v3_audit` reads the delivered corpus there, and the published logs quote it;
- the logs, check scripts and closure aids under `results/hexis31/`, published byte for byte by V3-007;
- the adopted acts, the historical records of the handoff and of the roadmap, and the tag `hexis31-v5-evidence`, which V3-007 names as the anchor of the evidence.

**Freeze perimeter.** No file of the perimeter changes: the occurrences of `hexis` in `src/hormathos`, `tests/`, `config/` and `pyproject.toml` are contract identifiers, schema names, the distribution name and the paths above. The code identity and the run ID `6aa1b719…` are unchanged.

**Documents.** The titles of the active documents read "deposited design 3.1" instead of "design HEXIS 3.1". The README, `results/README.md`, the specification, the bibliographic register (B03), the index, the roadmap, the handoff, the test inventory and the three instruction copies name the study HORMATHOS and the Release by its new tag. Of `docs/RESULTS.md` only the title changes; the wording that V3-007 (e) fixes is unchanged.

**Release.** The annotated tag `hormathos-v5-evidence` points to `9814871726bfec9dc96da316f61eeafbe58b3f48`, the commit of `hexis31-v5-evidence`, which remains and is never deleted. The GitHub Release moves to the new tag and takes the title "HORMATHOS evidence: complete campaign and superseded runs"; its assets and their SHA-256 are unchanged. As for the archive tags of V3-002, the normative anchor is the commit SHA, not the tag name.

**Decisions.**
- C1: reader-facing texts name the study HORMATHOS; HEXIS 3.1 survives once, as the working title of the deposit, and in the identifiers and paths listed above.
- C2: a new annotated tag `hormathos-v5-evidence` on the same commit carries the Release; the tag `hexis31-v5-evidence` stays.

## V3-009 — Figures for reading, 2026-09-25

**Status: ADOPTED.** Source of authorization: the owner's request of 25 September 2026 that the figures, unreadable at the width of a page, be redrawn one below the other and full width so that readers can study them, with a clear and professional design; one image per panel and a link from `docs/RESULTS.md`, as the owner chose. It modifies no byte of the deposit, of the acts V3-001 to V3-008, of `archive/`, of the published runs or of the freeze perimeter, and authorizes no run.

**Published.** `results/figures/`: 22 SVG panels, the gallery `README.md` and the script `make_figures.py` that draws them. The script reads the published tables of `v3-seed0-v3006` and the delivered corpus `v1`, parsing their floats exactly (`float_precision='round_trip'`), and reuses the data preparation of the frozen `hormathos.viz.plots`, `protocols.scores` and `model.diagnostics`; it fits nothing and reads no model, ledger or sample. Before drawing, it renders the five §11.6 figures from those tables with the frozen code and stops unless all five match the published SVGs byte for byte. Its output is deterministic.

**What the panels are.** A presentation of published values, not evidence: the canonical figures remain the five frozen SVGs of the run, listed with their hashes in its manifest and unchanged. Each panel draws what its frozen figure draws. The differences are of form only: one panel per image; horizontal dot plots with readable names; the block-by-band panel of the sensitivity figure split by band, with a labelled line per block; the leading 15 symbols of the 100- and 105-symbol R1 contributions drawn one by one and the rest in one summed bar, the sum checked against the centroid JSD; a nonzero mean below the displayed precision printed in scientific notation. The two presentation limits that `docs/RESULTS.md` records for the frozen figures — the clipped support bar at depth 5 and the unlabelled block means of the band panel — do not occur in the panels; the record stays as written, because it describes the frozen figures.

**Documents.** The README shows the Q-per-block panel under the main result and links the gallery. `results/README.md` describes `results/figures/`. In `docs/RESULTS.md`, whose wording V3-007 (e) fixes, only the figure table of "Existing figures and review boundary" changes: it gains a column linking each figure's reading version, and one paragraph after the table states that these versions are not evidence and do not replace the frozen figures.

**Freeze perimeter and Release.** `src/hormathos`, `tests/`, `conftest.py`, `config/`, `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` are unchanged: the new files lie under `results/`, which the sdist list already includes. The code identity and the run ID `6aa1b719…` are unchanged. The Release `hormathos-v5-evidence`, its assets and its tags are unchanged.

**Licences**, by the categories of V3-002 and V3-007: the panels derive from the corpus and are under CC BY-NC-SA 2.5; `make_figures.py` under MIT; the gallery page under CC BY 4.0, except the corpus-derived values it quotes.

## V3-010 — Reader-facing texts without internal references, 2026-09-25

**Status: ADOPTED.** Source of authorization: the owner's request of 25 September 2026 that a reader of the README, of the results and of the figures not meet technical terms left undefined or references internal to the project — phases, acts, sections of the plan, codes of settings, blocks and tables — and that every figure carry a short explanation beside it. The texts stay technical in register and in detail; only their vocabulary and references change. The owner authorized rewriting `docs/RESULTS.md` as one coherent text and approved the plan and its assumptions. It modifies no byte of the deposit, of the acts V3-001 to V3-009, of `archive/`, of the published runs or of the freeze perimeter, and authorizes no run.

**`docs/RESULTS.md`.** This act supersedes V3-007 (e) and V3-008 for its wording. It is rewritten as one statement: definitions first, then corpus, profiles, groups, sensitivities, annotation frequencies, diagnostics, figures, conclusions and limits, checks, and a table that maps every label to the codes of the published CSV files. Its 18 numerical tables keep every numeric cell byte for byte, in the same order; only labels and headers change, and they are numbered 1–18 in place of N1–X3. Every number in its text is taken from the previous wording or from the deposited plan. The account of the two reviews leaves this document: the statement of 25 September 2026 stays word for word in `docs/HANDOFF.md` at the tag `hormathos-v5-evidence` and in the Git history, and `docs/RESULTS.md` links it.

**Figures.** `results/figures/make_figures.py` changes only the texts of the panels — titles, subtitles, legends, axes — to plain names, and drops the run ID from their footer; data, drawing and the byte check of the five frozen figures are unchanged. The 22 panels are regenerated under the same names. `results/figures/README.md` opens with what is measured and gives each panel what it shows, how to read it and what to take from it.

**Other documents.** The README and `results/README.md` use the same vocabulary; the README keeps the identifiers that `test_v31_docs` requires, within one sentence that explains them. In `docs/00_INDEX.md` only the row of `RESULTS.md` and the list of acts change.

**Freeze perimeter and Release.** `src/hormathos`, `tests/`, `conftest.py`, `config/`, `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` are unchanged; the changed files are already in the sdist list. The code identity and the run ID `6aa1b719…` are unchanged. The Release `hormathos-v5-evidence`, its assets and its tags are unchanged.

**Licences**, by the categories of V3-002 and V3-007: the panels derive from the corpus and are under CC BY-NC-SA 2.5; `make_figures.py` under MIT; the documents under CC BY 4.0, except the corpus-derived values they quote.

## V3-011 — An introduction for every folder, 2026-09-26

**Status: ADOPTED.** Source of authorization: the owner's request of 26 September 2026 that a reader who opens any folder of the repository find a short introduction there: what the folder holds, why it is there, what its files are and how to move among them. The README's list of folders was not enough, because GitHub shows only a folder's own `README` when the folder is opened. The owner approved the plan and ruled on its two questions of perimeter, recorded below. The act modifies no byte of the deposit, of the acts V3-001 to V3-010, of `archive/` or of the published runs, and authorizes no run.

**New pages.** `docs/README.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/contracts/hexis-3.1-en/README.md`, `src/README.md`, `tests/README.md`, `config/README.md`, `data/README.md` and `results/hexis31/README.md`. Each says what the folder is, why it is there, what it contains and where to go next, and, where it applies, why its files must not change. They use the vocabulary of V3-010.

**Where no page is placed.** Four places are described from outside:

- `archive/`: every file there must hold the bytes of the same path at `5f1ec06` (V3-002), and its `README.md` is the project's old front page. `docs/README.md` and the README warn the reader.
- `docs/contracts/hexis-3.1/`: it is the deposit, and the pipeline refuses a contract folder holding any file its checksums do not list. `docs/contracts/README.md` describes it.
- The run folders under `results/hexis31/`: `validate_run` compares the files present with the manifest. `results/hexis31/README.md` describes them.
- `src/hormathos/`: `src/README.md`, one level up, covers it.

**Other documents.** In the README, the layout table links each folder to its page and warns about `archive/`. `results/README.md` names its describing pages as the only files not written by the pipeline, a check or the figure script. Before this act it said that no file there had been edited, which the figure gallery of V3-009 had already made inexact. `docs/00_INDEX.md` links `docs/README.md` and lists this act. `.gitignore` admits `results/hexis31/README.md`.

**Freeze perimeter.** The owner ruled on two points:

- `tests/README.md` and `config/README.md` sit in folders of the perimeter. No identity reads them: the code identity hashes the `.py` files of `src/hormathos/`, the test context hashes the `.py` files of `tests/`, `conftest.py` and `pyproject.toml`, and a run hashes its configuration file and the registry by name.
- `pyproject.toml` changes only its sdist `only-include` list, which gains `"data/README.md"` and `"docs/README.md"`, as `test_the_sdist_ships_exactly_the_tracked_tree` requires of every tracked file.

As after V3-007, the code identity and the run ID `6aa1b719…` are unchanged. The test context of `master` changes only in the hash of `pyproject.toml`, and the evidence stays fixed at the tag `hormathos-v5-evidence`. `src/hormathos`, the `.py` files of `tests/`, `conftest.py`, the configuration files and `uv.lock` are unchanged. The Release, its assets and its tags are unchanged.

**Licences**, by the categories of V3-002 and V3-007: the new pages are documents, under CC BY 4.0.

## V3-012 — A guide for the archive and English in place of Italian, 2026-09-27

**Status: ADOPTED.** Source of authorization: the owner's requests of 26 September 2026 that `archive/` open with a guide like every other folder, and that the Italian texts of the repository be replaced by their English translation. The owner approved the plan and ruled that the deposit stays as it is and that the Git history is not rewritten. The act modifies no byte of the deposit, of the published runs or of the code, and authorizes no run.

**Principle.** An Italian original keeps governing, and its bytes are never lost, but since this act it need not sit in the tree. Each replaced text is kept byte for byte in Git at a published tag. Its English translation, placed where the text stood, opens with a header that names the original, where Git keeps it and its SHA-256, and `tests/test_v31_docs.py` checks each header against those bytes. For the texts listed below, this supersedes:

- the rule of V3-002 that every file of `archive/` holds the bytes its path had at `5f1ec06`, and the row of its table that places the README of `5f1ec06` at `archive/README.md`;
- the sentences of V3-003 and of the standing instructions that keep V3-001 and V3-002 in the log in their Italian originals;
- the statement of V3-011 that `archive/` cannot hold an introduction.

**Decision log.** The three V3-001 blocks and the V3-002 act are given in English. The text is the companion translation of V3-003, unchanged except its header, which becomes a note under the first heading of each act. The Italian originals are at the tag `hormathos-v5-evidence`, with SHA-256 `8ee0f130ac59085862c940c0804fc25733a7a12f9e83bb0abf95c18c9fba8864` and `094a686e52841202b7185d383f48f1e8619e8ae11db934ea61a6966b7d01c5ed`, identical to the log before this act. The separate companions in `docs/contracts/hexis-3.1-en/decision-log/` are removed with their two pairs in `pairs_all.json`. The test that pinned the Italian V3-001 bytes is retired with its reason and replaced by one that checks two things: at the tag, both hashes and the Italian heading of V3-002; in the log, that each English act names the hash of its original. The log's preamble says so.

**Archive.** `archive/README.md` becomes a guide to the folder: what each part was, what was abandoned, how to run it at `5f1ec06`, and how the translations work. The old front page, `README.md` at `5f1ec06` (SHA-256 `41c79416…`), moves in translation to `archive/README_at_5f1ec06.md`. The other Italian texts are translated in place, a PDF becoming a Markdown file with the same name. With the first 12 hex digits of each original's SHA-256:

- `docs/HANDOFF.md` (`6cf7a46d7d0f`), `docs/TEST_INVENTORY.md` (`01684571b4c3`), `docs/V2_RECONCILIATION.md` (`028f8f4832c4`), `docs/g1_ratification_record.md` (`6a825db2e658`);
- `docs/audit/CHANGELOG_RIALLINEAMENTO_v2_1.md` (`e3974f14af66`), `docs/audit/RESTAURO_01_MASTER_SPEC.md` (`1cd156432f06`) and `docs/audit/AUDIT_EDITS_v2_1.json` (`d76cc2164b98`). In the JSON only the Italian string values and their labels are translated. The keys, order and other values are unchanged; a first key, `_translation`, carries the header, since JSON has no comments;
- `docs/history/v2.1/00_LEGGIMI_INDICE.md` (`f144ec184836`), `03_ROADMAP_OPERATIVA_IT.md` (`4b9e215083f6`) and `INDEX.md` (`7713c0f6b874`). For the first two, the test also checks the header against `SHA256SUMS.json` of that folder, which is unchanged;
- `HEXIS_research_proposal.pdf` (`9b199ee75985`), `docs/archive_v2_0_pdf/00_LEGGIMI_INDICE.pdf` (`9bee6b2d7568`) and `03_ROADMAP_OPERATIVA_IT.pdf` (`0dde74cebb3f`), as `.md`. Two archived texts that stay byte for byte, `README_v1_backup.md` and `docs/history/v2.1/README.md`, link the PDF proposal: the first link now points to a path that holds its translation under another extension, and the second was already broken at `5f1ec06`. They are records, and they are not edited.

The paths are those of `archive/` without the prefix; the originals are at `5f1ec06`, tag `archive/pre-realign`. The test admits exactly these translations, closed in `ARCHIVE_TRANSLATIONS`, and the guide. Every other file of `archive/` keeps the bytes of its path at `5f1ec06`. The English files of the archive that quote a few Italian words, the code and the tests are unchanged.

**What stays Italian.**

- The deposit in `docs/contracts/hexis-3.1/`, which the code and the published runs verify byte for byte. Its English translations reproduce unchanged the code they quote from its scripts, Italian messages included, with a translator's note.
- File names and identifiers that the contracts fix or that records cite, such as `LEGGIMI.md`, `corpus_atteso_v3.1.json` or `03_ROADMAP_OPERATIVA_IT.md`.
- The Italian heading of V3-002, which the test reads at the tag.
- The Git history: rewriting five old commit messages would change every later commit and break the tags and the Release.
- The drafts in `docs/proposal/`, which are not tracked and not part of the repository.

**Tranches.** A: the guide, the translated front page, the decision log, the tests, the standing instructions and the reader-facing pages (README, `docs/README.md`, `docs/00_INDEX.md`, `docs/01_MASTER_SPEC.md`, the two pages of `docs/contracts/`). B: the four texts of `archive/docs/`. C: the audit, v2.1 and the PDFs. Each tranche extends `ARCHIVE_TRANSLATIONS` and passes the full acceptance.

**Freeze perimeter.** `tests/test_v31_docs.py` changes, and `tests/test_v31_enforcement.py` changes only the name of the replaced test in its list of required behaviours; `docs/TEST_INVENTORY.md` describes the new checks. The test context of `master` changes in the hashes of these two files. The code identity and the run ID `6aa1b719…` are unchanged, and the evidence stays fixed at the tag `hormathos-v5-evidence`. `src/hormathos`, `conftest.py`, `config/`, `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` are unchanged. The Release, its assets and its tags are unchanged.

**Licences**, by the categories of V3-002: the translations and the guide are documents, under CC BY 4.0, as their originals.
