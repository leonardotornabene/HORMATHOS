# HORMATHOS test inventory — deposited design 3.1, V3-001, V3-002, V3-003

Active acceptance: **every collected test is `v31`**, with an executed assert and no skip,
xfail or xpass. `pytest` and `pytest -m v31` collect the same tests: the rule is enforced
in `conftest.py` at collection, not read off the summary by eye. The named inventory in
`tests/test_v31_enforcement.py` must match the actual collection in both directions.
The comparison with the deposited contract does not replace the CTW tests, and the four
deposited CTW fixtures are identified, not executed.
The named inventory also pins reviewed case counts for every parametrized test; removing one
parameter case fails acceptance.

## Obligations T01–T30 of §12

| ID | Status | Coverage / remaining obligation |
|---|---|---|
| T01 | V1 | Inputs/hashes, sent_id, 18 prefixes/17 documents |
| T02 | V1 | Document/block counts and whole corpus |
| T03 | V1 | Parsing, coordinates, identity, located errors |
| T04 | V1 | Global mapping, inventories, C0/UPOS, inventory_only |
| T05 | V2 | Held-out and `inventory_only` excluded from training, in all six cells for seven folds |
| T06 | V2 | Exact q, no replacement, ≤1 fragment per contributor, empty and impossible budgets |
| T07 | V2 | Source order; sampler invariant to record order and blind to labels; reuse of ledger and permutation as declared |
| T08 | V2 | §12.2 vector and seven deposited `block_key`s, separate purposes, repeatability, O/R pairing; no probe purpose active |
| T09 | V2 | Streams/reset and exact partition of the sample; terminal BOS and partition of counts in T10–T11 |
| T10 | V2 | Independent enumeration of the admissible trees against evidence, root weight and prediction |
| T11 | V2 | Normalisation, rare/unseen support, empty training, D=0, m100/105/11, strict inputs |
| T12 | V2 | Prequential/integrated identity before update; invariance to stream order |
| T13 | V2 | Counts/evidence/weights/fingerprint unchanged by evaluation |
| T14 | V2 | Extreme prior in log space, two weights from δ, saturation distinct from forced leaves |
| T15 | V2 | 25 synthetic sources at the §12.1 thresholds on the canonical CTW; violation → non-zero exit |
| T16 | V2 | Historical m106 stress: execution, normalisation, supports, recorded deficit |
| T17 | V2 | Length, multiset, mask and root counts preserved; slot distinct from provenance |
| T18 | V2 | Counterexamples of internal dependence and of a heterogeneous pool at sample level and in G/Q: non-null G_R with two fitted models |
| T19 | V2 | Four-term Q; archived sign-inversion counterexample reproduced on the canonical CTW |
| T20 | V2 | Aggregations/two weights |
| T21 | V2 | Paired sensitivities |
| T22 | V2 | Masses/supports/L_resolved |
| T23 | V2 | R1 |
| T24 | CODE pre-V3, EXECUTED V5 | Census of the six inventory_only (V1); the report validator regenerates every ledger from the RNG contract, so no held-out/inventory_only in training, and refuses any inventory_only scoring: code and tests in `0dc69b5`; executed on the campaign by the report of 25 September 2026 |
| T25 | V4–V5 | Equality of the 490/980 model/pair keys: step 3 of the report validator, and the independent check of 25 September 2026 |
| T26 | V2 | Atomicity/interruption, resume, corruption, duplicates and extra keys: corpus (V1) and scientific stage (V2) |
| T27 | CODE V2, EXECUTED V5 | Reconstruction of scores/diagnostics and five figures: code and fixture tests in `559dc40`, fixes from the pre-V3 review (samples, shuffle and C0 provenance regenerated; figures readable at real cardinality) in `0dc69b5`; executed on the campaign by the report of 25 September 2026 |
| T28 | V0–V1 | Pipeline without candidates/inference; acceptance without skip |
| T29 | V1, V5 | Corpus identity/round trip; samples and shuffle regenerated for every pair (`0dc69b5`); CE/model reproduction: seed-0 regeneration 70/70 identical in the report of 25 September 2026 |
| T30 | V5 | Complete scientific report: no partial contrast; bytes, contract, key sets, R1 and denominators checked by the report of 25 September 2026 |

## What each active file proves

| File | Properties |
|---|---|
| `test_v31_config.py` | Deposit and projection field by field, refused types and values, safe YAML and duplicates at every depth, error naming the original file, isolation of non-3.1 configurations |
| `test_conllu_reader.py` | Streaming parsing, identity and order, MWT and empty-node rows, located errors, blindness to the representation |
| `test_v31_corpus.py` | T01–T04: exact real census, coordinates and numeric order, parts and ordinals, mapping, ADV/PART merge, masks, targets, A/B diagnostics, semantic corruptions |
| `test_v31_persistence.py` | T26/T29: three exact inputs, staging of the bytes read, run identity, atomic publication, collisions and concurrency, interruption, corruption, destinations outside the raw data |
| `test_v31_context_tree.py` | T10–T16: independent enumeration, BOS and partition, numerics, prequential identity, frozen model, §12.1 battery and m=106 stress |
| `test_v31_sampling.py` | T05–T09, T17–T18: deposited RNG vector, ledger, exclusions, fragments, reset streams without separators, paired shuffle |
| `test_v31_scores.py` | T19–T22: four losses, paired slots, four-term Q, two weightings, diagnostics and the public signatures of §11.1 |
| `test_v31_r1.py` | T23: JSD, symmetry, centroids and contributions |
| `test_v31_descriptive.py`, `test_v31_completion.py`, `test_v31_report_semantics.py` | Runner and report on fixtures: partitions, resume, evidence, keys, regeneration, semantic guards; absence of the retired modules |
| `test_v31_validation_run.py` | V2/V3 evidence executed and rechecked; the report refuses a changed V2 context, also during generation; a single cell at seed 0 leaves V3 pending; real fits require clean tracked producers |
| `test_v31_figures.py` | The five figures of §11.6, derived from the verified tables |
| `test_v31_docs.py` | Active authority, deposit integrity, archive at the bytes of `5f1ec06` file by file, except its guide and the English translations that V3-012 lists, each bound to the SHA-256 of its original; V3-001 and V3-002 bound to their Italian originals at the tag `hormathos-v5-evidence`, identity of the three instruction copies, absence of retired imports; the package is `hormathos` and `hexis` is not importable, and the sdist is exactly the tracked tree (V3-003) |
| `test_v31_enforcement.py`, `test_gate_inventory_anchor.py` | The gate itself: exhaustive inventory in both directions, refusal of skip, xfail, xpass even when not strict, missing or dead assert, `.pyc` without the hook, test without marker, missing or unmarked anchor, archive never collected, not even from the root |
| `test_v31_pre_v3_audit.py` | Pre-V3 audit regressions: publication commit, named extras, plotting rounding, regeneration tolerance and exact Parquet identities, raw aliases, fixtures, block overlap, private corpus read, lexical order of sentences and coordinates, staged parser input, descriptive context and JUnit outcomes; the coordinate order, the unreadable-manifest rollback and the raw alias missed by `resolve()` added by V3-005 |
| `test_v31_pre_v4_review.py` | Pre-V4 review regressions (V3-006): sequence eligibility read from `min_available_past`, and the scorer's bounded history window with losses equal to the full-prefix prediction |

## Map of the previous tests (§13.2: kept, replaced, retired)

Every test function collected at `5f1ec06` and not marked `v31` has a destination.
"Migrated" means the property is now in an active test; "covered" that an active test
already proved it; "replaced" that 3.1 requires another property, named here; "archived"
that the property holds only for the retired code, preserved in `archive/` and executable
at `5f1ec06`. Test paths are those of `5f1ec06`; the package of that commit is `hexis`.

## Remaining obligations

- **V3**: executed on 24 September 2026, reviewed, re-attested under V3-005 and, after the pre-V4 review, under V3-006 in `results/hexis31/v3-seed0-v3006` (see HANDOFF): technical trial at seed 0 on six cells and seven folds (42 pairs / 84 models), resource measurements, freeze of code and environment; publication of the V2/V3 evidence in the manifest.
- **V4**: executed on 24 September 2026 in `results/hexis31/v3-seed0-v3006` (see HANDOFF): full campaign, 490 pairs / 980 model identities, equality of the key sets (T25); the three R1 are computed by the report.
- **V5**: report executed on 25 September 2026 in the same directory: five figures, two weightings, three R1 and the prescribed regeneration of seed 0 (T24, T27, T29, T30); completed on the same day by the statement of results and limitations without selection of the sign (§14 V5, §16) in RESULTS.md and by the README after V5 (§17.2).
- PENDING, outside V0–V5: the research proposal (§17.1). The act for the publication of the C0 position vectors and other corpus derivatives (§17.3) is V3-007, 25 September 2026.
- V3-008, 25 September 2026, changes documents and the Release only: no test and no file of the freeze perimeter.
- None of the V3–V5 obligations is covered by fixtures: executing them required real fits.
